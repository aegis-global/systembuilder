Dependencies

To ensure an efficient workflow, I'll outline dependencies and prerequisites across the tasks and organize them into a logical order for implementation. Tasks that rely on others will be flagged, and I'll highlight those that can be done in parallel to maximize development efficiency.

- **Dependency**: Needs service generator and blueprint parser.
- **Order**: After service generator.

#### **3.3. Database Generator**
- **Dependency**: Tied to API generator and blueprint parsing.
- **Order**: After API generator.

#### **3.4. Dockerfile Generator**
- **Dependency**: Relies on service definitions from blueprint parser.
- **Order**: After service generator is ready.

#### **3.5. Kubernetes Manifest Generator**
- **Dependency**: Requires services and possibly databases to be generated first.
- **Order**: After the service generator and database generator are complete.

---

### **4. Conversational AI (Optional)**

#### **4.1. Intent Detection**
- **Dependency**: Requires basic blueprint designer input processing and backend services.
- **Order**: Start after basic user input processing is operational.

#### **4.2. Entity Recognition**
- **Dependency**: Needs blueprint designer input handling and some form of API to recognize blueprint elements.
- **Order**: After intent detection.

#### **4.3. System Definition Assistant**
- **Dependency**: Requires NLP features like intent detection and entity recognition.
- **Order**: After NLP features are functional.

---

### **5. Backend Server**

#### **5.1. API Gateway**
- **Dependency**: Services need to be generated first.
- **Order**: After service generator is working, but can be done in parallel with other backend tasks.

#### **5.2. Input Processing Service**
- **Dependency**: Needs the frontend's basic user input and blueprint handling.
- **Order**: After blueprint parser and frontend input handling.

#### **5.3. Code Generation Service**
- **Dependency**: Depends on code generation engine's service generator and blueprint parser.
- **Order**: After the service generator.

#### **5.4. File Storage**
- **Dependency**: Depends on the code generation service being operational.
- **Order**: After code generation service is implemented.

---

### **6. Integration and Configuration Management**

#### **6.1. Service Discovery**
- **Dependency**: Services need to be generated, and Kubernetes manifest generation should be ready.
- **Order**: After service generation and Kubernetes manifests.

#### **6.2. Configuration Management**
- **Dependency**: Needs generated services and Docker/Kubernetes files.
- **Order**: After Dockerfile and Kubernetes manifest generation.

#### **6.3. API Gateway Configuration**
- **Dependency**: Requires the API gateway to be set up and services to be generated.
- **Order**: After service generator and API gateway.

---

### **7. Testing and Validation**

#### **7.1. Test Generation**
- **Dependency**: Service and API generation must be ready to write test templates.
- **Order**: After the service and API generator.

#### **7.2. Load Testing and Monitoring**
- **Dependency**: Basic services need to be functional to test their load and monitor performance.
- **Order**: After initial service generation and deployment setup.

---

### **8. Version Control and Collaboration**

#### **8.1. Versioning System**
- **Dependency**: Needs the blueprint designer and code generation service.
- **Order**: After blueprint design and basic services are operational.

#### **8.2. Collaboration Tools**
- **Dependency**: Requires blueprint designer and real-time input handling to be implemented.
- **Order**: After the core frontend and blueprint designer are set up.

### **Logical Order for Implementation**

1. **Frontend:**
   - Start with **UI Components** and **User Input Handling** (Tasks 1.1 and 1.2).
   - Implement **Blueprint Schema** (Task 2.1) and **Parsing Functions** (Task 2.2) in parallel with UI development.
   - Proceed to **Blueprint Validation** and **Error Handling** (Tasks 2.3 and 2.4).
   - Next, add **Real-time Feedback** (Task 1.3) and **Form Validation** (Task 1.4).

2. **Code Generation Engine:**
   - Implement **Service Generator** (Task 3.1) once the blueprint schema and parsing are functional.
   - Follow up with **API Generator** (Task 3.2), **Database Generator** (Task 3.3), **Dockerfile Generator** (Task 3.4), and **Kubernetes Manifest Generator** (Task 3.5).

3. **Backend Server:**
   - Set up **API Gateway** (Task 5.1) and **Input Processing Service** (Task 5.2) once initial code generation is ready.
   - Implement the **Code Generation Service** (Task 5.3) and **File Storage** (Task 5.4).

4. **Integration and Configuration:**
   - Develop **Service Discovery** (Task 6.1) after services are generated and deployed.
   - Set up **Configuration Management** (Task 6.2) and **API Gateway Configuration** (Task 6.3) once services are operational.

5. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Begin writing **Test Generation Templates** (Task 7.1) once services and APIs are generated.
   - Add **Load Testing and Monitoring** (Task 7.2) after the system is minimally functional.

6. **Version Control and Collaboration:**
   - Implement the **Versioning System** (Task 8.1) after the blueprint designer is ready.
   - Add **Collaboration Tools** (Task 8.2) once real-time input and blueprint management are functional.
