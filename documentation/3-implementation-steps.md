Implementation Steps


Breaking down each functionality into **implementation steps** involves identifying specific technical tasks that can be individually implemented. These tasks should be as atomic as possible, representing self-contained units of work that can be easily tracked and managed. I will go through each of the core functionalities and break them down into **implementation tasks**.
