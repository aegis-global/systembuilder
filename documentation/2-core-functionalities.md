   - **Entity Detection**: Identifies key system components (e.g., microservices, databases) from natural language descriptions.
   - **Action Mapping**: Maps natural language actions to system actions (e.g., “connect X to Y” translates to API connection).
   - **Error Checking**: Validates the structure and ensures no missing components or relationships in the description.

#### **2.2. Diagram Serializer**
   - **Component Serialization**: Converts each visual component on the canvas into a structured format (e.g., JSON, YAML).
   - **Connection Serialization**: Saves the relationships or connections between components (e.g., service A calls service B).
   - **Position Data**: Stores the position and layout data of the components for UI rendering later.
   - **Export/Import Functionality**: Enables exporting the serialized data and importing it back to the canvas.

#### **2.3. System Blueprint**
   - **Unified Data Model**: Combines the parsed natural language or diagram input into a single structured blueprint.
   - **Component Structure**: Stores the metadata of each component, including types, attributes, and relationships.
   - **Validation Engine**: Ensures all required components are present and correctly connected.
   - **Versioning and History Tracking**: Tracks changes made to the blueprint over time for versioning purposes.

   - **Containerized Infrastructure**: Predefined Docker configurations for services, databases, and messaging queues.
   - **Kubernetes Templates**: Predefined templates for deploying services on Kubernetes (K8s manifests, Helm charts).
   - **Service Mesh Configurations**: Predefined templates for integrating services with a service mesh (e.g., Istio).

   - **Inter-service Communication**: Sets up communication between services via HTTP, gRPC, or messaging systems like Kafka or RabbitMQ.
   - **Error Handling & Resilience**: Adds resilience patterns (e.g., retries, circuit breakers) in the generated code.

#### **4.3. Infrastructure Generator**
   - **Dockerfile Generator**: Creates Dockerfiles for each component, ensuring containerization.
   - **CI/CD Pipeline Generator**: Automatically generates CI/CD pipeline scripts (e.g., Jenkinsfile, GitHub Actions).
   - **Deployment Scripts**: Generates deployment scripts for Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or other environments.

### **5. Conversational AI (Optional)**

#### **5.1. NLP for Interpreting Descriptions**
   - **Intent Recognition**: Identifies user intentions from natural language input (e.g., "Create an API").
   - **Entity Extraction**: Extracts key entities like microservices, databases, or APIs from user input.
   - **Dialogue Management**: Handles conversational flow and context to guide the user through system definition.
